### This directoy contains useful scripts for a variety of different usecases of DQFNO

#### In this directory we have:
- train.py this is the main commandline tool that is used for training a autoregressive DQFNO in a very standard method using data that have been created by splitting many simulations and trying to learn not only the physics but also to generalize to new intiail conditions
- TODO: implement a notebook doing the train.py stuff end to end
- utils.py various training utils used in train.py
